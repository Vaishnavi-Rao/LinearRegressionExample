# LinearRegressionExample
Linear regression is used when we are dealing with continuous sets of data. This is a simple machine learning programme to predict the relationship between the head size and the brain weight of different users using linear regression.
The data is in the form of a .csv format that contains the following details about the users - Gender, Age Range, Head Size and Brain Weight.
In this code, I first find the slope and coefficient to plot the Linear Regression line to find the best fit for the dataset. AFter this, I use the R-squared method to find out how good our model is.
R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression.
